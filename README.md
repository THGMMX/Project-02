### INTRODUCTION
This is an app project that aims to extract statistical data from lawsuits to provide strategic data for lawyers.

In its development I aimed to implement CRUD requests to extract data from API where information about lawsuits is found.

I also intend to implement a page for reports, where graphs of the data extracted from the lawsuits page will be generated.

### GETTING STARTED
As it is based on brazilian lawsuits, the app is in portuguese.

On the "Processos" page you will find a list of lawsuits, where the data extracted from the API are stored.

Functions to create, edit and delete lawsuits are available and working.

On the "Relat√≥rios" page, which has not yet been created, I intend to display graphs of the data of the lawsuits held in the page "Processos".
